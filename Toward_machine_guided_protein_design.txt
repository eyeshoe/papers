Title: Toward machine-guided design of proteins

Abstract:
- Supervised learning can be used to improve protein design
- Hybrid optimization strategy potentially: wet lab and validation stages
- Directed evolution??

Introduction:
- Protein engineering is useful for medicine, industrial purposes
- Find a sequence that encodes a protein with a desired function
- ML and wet lab experimentation
- GFP protein (fluorescent) used to determine fitness of a sequence

Biological Background:
-
