Title: All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks

Abstract:
- Physical mechanism to perform machine learning
- 3-d printed neural networks
- Performs at the speed of light

Paper:
- Neural network uses diffractive layers to physically perform a function
- Inference capabilities through stimulation and experiments as results
- Performs computations through optical diffraction and passive optical components
- Efficient and fast way: phase and amplitude of each neuron can be learned
- Optimized using error back-prop algorithm --> based off of stochastic gradient descent

Experiment:
- Trained a digit classifier using MNIST, goal is to find the detector with max optical signal
- Classification accuracy of 91.75%
- Initial model improvedusing a 2 layer patch
- 3D printed this neural network design, and numerical testing: 91.75% accuracy
- Had some issues with 3-D printing the digit "0"
- Next trained on the fashion MNIST database
- As they increased the number of diffractive layers, the accuracy increased
