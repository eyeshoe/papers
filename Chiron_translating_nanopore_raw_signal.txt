Title: Chiron: translating nanopore raw signal directly into nucleotide sequence using deep learning

Abstract:
- Chiron is a deep learning model that doesn't ahve the error prone segmentation step
- Chiron provides state of the art accuracy, and does it fast (2000 bases per second)

Introduction:
- MinION is extremely portable, also works in real time
- Initially, basecalling was segmentation and then translation
- Uses dynamic programming
- Chiron is both CNN and RNN, doesn't need segmentation step
- Chiron easily generalizes to a range of other genomes
- Users can train their own neural network

Results:
- Segmentation free basecalling, predicts a complete DNA sequence from raw signal
- Ground truth was Illumina technology based
- Chiron is a little bit slower than other NN algorithms

Discussion:
- Segmentation is appealing but error-prone, so it makes conservative estimates w/ Chiron
- Chiron saw no human data during training but was consistently either the best or second best performing algorithm
- Can increase in accuracy and there are various methods to do so

Conclusion:
- Method is sufficiently generalizable to account for other species
