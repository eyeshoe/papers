Title: Chiron: translating nanopore raw signal directly into nucleotide sequence using deep learning

Abstract:
- Chiron is a deep learning model that doesn't ahve the error prone segmentation step
- Chiron provides state of the art accuracy, and does it fast (2000 bases per second)

Introduction:
- MinION is extremely portable, also works in real time
- Initially, basecalling was segmentation and then translation
- Uses dynamic programming
- Chiron is both CNN and RNN, doesn't need segmentation step
- Chiron easily generalizes to a range of other genomes
- Users can train their own neural network

Results:
-
