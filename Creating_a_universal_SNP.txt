Title: Creating a universal SNP and small indel variant caller with deep neural networks


Abstract:
- DeepVariant: works across genomes and other species
- Goal is to build a more accurate SNP variant caller

Main Text:
- Regular NGS reads are errorful and result from a complex error process that depends on a lot of factors
- GATK uses statistical modeling
- This paper is going for a single Deep Learning model --> this is DeepVariant
- Model was trained without specialized knowledge about genomics or NGS
- Still more successful than other models, it competed better too
- Can apply models learned from one version of human genome to other ones
- DeepVariant is robust to protocols, instruments, genomes and species
- DeepVariant performs well on Genome in a Bottle data, but it's not an indicator of everything
- This is better for a generalizable process rather than the usually laborious NGS process
- Data is likely applicable for other processes

Limitations:
- Rewritted DeepVariant since this paper was released
- Switched to TensorFlow, saw major improvements
- Code is on github
