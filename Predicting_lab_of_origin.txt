Title: Deep learning to predict the lab-of-origin of engineered DNA

Abstract:
- Can cinstruct cells for malicious intent
- Need to determine the origin of a DNA strand, but it's time consuming
- CNN, identifieds a combination of design choices used to mark DNA

Experiment:
- Many design choices leave signatures in the DNA: codon pairs etc.
- Scar sequences from construction methods, silent mutations across projects
- Train a CNN to predict the lab of origin

Results:
-
