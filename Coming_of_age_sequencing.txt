Title: Coming of age: ten years of next-generation sequencing technologies

- NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) techniques are evolving, allowing us to learn more about the genome
- Read lengths as long as entire genomes
- Careful examination of results required, high error rates and a lot of information
- Still relatively expensive
- Goal: evaluate various approaches to NGS

Short-read NGS:
- Everything is being done with Illumina products
- Tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity
- Some error probabilities with A-T rich areas
- Illumina is expensive though


Long-read sequencing:
- Because sometimes short-read is insufficient
- PacBio RS II instrument, analogous to Sanger-based SNP validation??
- Can take time
- MinION --> 30% error rate
