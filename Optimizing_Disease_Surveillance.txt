Title: Optimizing Disease Surveillance by Reporting on the Blockchain

Abstract:
- Disease surveillance is inefficient
- Blockchain system is optimized, maintains costs and is more efficient

Introduction:
- Blockchain: distributed ledgers for safekeeping info. No centralized management
- Bitcoin uses blockchain, some health records could also
- Disease monitoring systems can also use it --> aggregate large amounts of data and report back
- Key features pointed out in the paper

Architecture:
- Distributed ledger systems are blockchaines or DAGS
- Using DAG architecture here
- Nodes, addresses and transactions 
- Signing a transaction by way of private keys
- Validation algorithm
- Can't create fake reports without stealing private keys
- This system architecture fulfills all of the key features noted earlier

Deployment:
- Can also be deployed on linear blockchain platform
- Pros and cons to using the DAG architecture

Discussion and Conclusion:
- Distributed storage of database is better for disease detection
- Drawback is lack of support for smart contracts
- Only for first stage disease surveillance
