Title: Controlling an organic synthesis robot with ML to search for new reactivity

Abstract:
- Reaction prediction is of chemical reactions
- Organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical reactions faster than manually
- Machine learning for decision making
- Testing on existing datasets and manual experiments
- Results include the discovery of four reactions
