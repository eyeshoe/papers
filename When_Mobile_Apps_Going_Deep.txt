Title: When Mobile Apps Going Deep: Mobile Deep Learning

Abstract:
- How is deep learning used within mobile apps
- Analysis of apps and performance

Introduction:
- Many deep learning frameworks for smartphones i.e. TensorFlow Lite
- Execute Deep Learning inference solely on smartphones
- Empirical study about Android apps using Deep learning
- Photo beauty is the top use for DL, despite obvious optimizations
- It's easy to extract most models 

Background:
- DL is good for algorithm accuracy,  models and frameworks
- Can use the cloud to deploy to an app
- On cloud vs on device is a tradeoff

Goal and Methodology:
- Goal: how do apps use DL?
- Analyzing tool to work on a large scale within apps
- Deep Learning Sniffer
- Look at manifest files and the deep learning models


Application Analysis:
-
