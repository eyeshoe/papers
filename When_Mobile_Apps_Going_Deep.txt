Title: When Mobile Apps Going Deep: Mobile Deep Learning

Abstract:
- How is deep learning used within mobile apps
- Analysis of apps and performance

Introduction:
- Many deep learning frameworks for smartphones i.e. TensorFlow Lite
- Execute Deep Learning inference solely on smartphones
- Empirical study about Android apps using Deep learning
- Photo beauty is the top use for DL, despite obvious optimizations
- It's easy to extract most models 

Background:
- DL is good for algorithm accuracy,  models and frameworks
- Can use the cloud to deploy to an app
- On cloud vs on device is a tradeoff

Goal and Methodology:
- Goal: how do apps use DL?
- Analyzing tool to work on a large scale within apps
- Deep Learning Sniffer
- Look at manifest files and the deep learning models


Application Analysis:
- Looking to analyze the role of Deep learning in these apps and
how it's correlated to popularity
- Methodology looks for the type of deep learning framework used
from the rodata file
- Many smartphones are running deep learning apps now
- DL used for a variety of uses, but most of these apps are from larger companies
that have the resources to build such apps
- Image processing is the most popular use on apps
- Deep Learning is used in a core feature of these apps
- TensorFlow is the most common framework used, followed by TFLite and ncnn
- DL Libs require a lot more storage

Model Analysis:
- Extracted DL models using a model extractor
- Mostly CNN models, some RNN models
- Mostly conv layers, some optimizations also used
- Used FLOPs to measure computational complexity
- Almost half the models are either obfuscated or encrypted
- Most DL models are actually exposed
