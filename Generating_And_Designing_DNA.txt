Title: Generating and Designing DNA with Deep Generative Models

Abstract:
- Three approaches to creating DNA sequences for a particular purpose. 
- GAN, Deep Dream, Joint Procedure

Introduction:
- Deep Dream is activation maximization
- Can use GANs for a lot of stuff in genomics
- Overall Goal: create synthetic DNA sequencing and tune them

Generative Design of DNA:
- Generative modeling vs generative organization
- Use one hot encodings
- Goal of a generative model is to capture realistic structure
- GANs have a generator and a discriminator
- Train GANs using both real and synthetic data
- GANs work better on continuous domains, recently they are alright on discrete sequences
- This task is an optimization problem
- Joint method is better because it does not ignore realism or typicality of data

Computational Experiments:
- Model learns DNA complementary base pairings
- Designing DNA sequences with particualr affinities
- Can optimize multiple properties (also competing) with the deep dream method

Summary and Future Work:
- There's a lot of useful places where you can use GANs in genomics and DNA stuff
