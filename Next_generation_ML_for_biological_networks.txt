Title: Next-Generation ML for Biological Networks

Abstract:
- ML can be used to study complex cellular systems
- Primer on ML for life scientists

Introduction:
- Significant increase in datasets and the quality of data in them
- ML is useful to learn patterns from data and develop a predictive model
- Can find patterns that humans can't really see
- Paper is exploring opportunities for ML in biological system analysis

A Primer on ML:
- Generate predictive models based on algorithms and data
- Input is features and labels
- Can use supervised or unsupervised learning
- Applying ML in Biological contexts means maybe no generalization
- Performance is affected by multiple factors, not just data
- DREAM challenges are a good place for ML stuff
- Deep Learning is useful because of better performance on less data
- Data transforms are learned by the machine
- Drawback of Deep Learning is that it requires more data in general to be good

Intersection of ML and Network Biology:
