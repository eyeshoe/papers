Title: CADS: CRISPRS Assisted DNA Steganograpy for Securing the Storage and Transfer of DNA-encoded Information

Abstract:
- DNA steganography: conceals DNA encoded messages
- Works through "secret message" techniques and junk DNA, message extracted through PCR
- Need more message security --> mix primers to get varying results
- Goal is to develop a method with better security
