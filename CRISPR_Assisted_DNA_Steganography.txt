Title: CADS: CRISPRS Assisted DNA Steganograpy for Securing the Storage and Transfer of DNA-encoded Information

Abstract:
- DNA steganography: conceals DNA encoded messages
- Works through "secret message" techniques and junk DNA, message extracted through PCR
- Need more message security --> mix primers to get varying results
- Goal is to develop a method with better security

Keywords:
- The key is critical to the security of storage/transfer of data
- CRISPR associated protein helps to create a new DNA steganography method
- Keys are primers, need keys and the encryption rules to decode DNA messages
- CADS is useful in creating 2 keys with real and fake primers
- Testing the fake primer removal using Cas12a complex treatment
- Random primers were also added to make the primer mix more robust

Methods:
- PCR, then purification and self-ligation, then inserted into the plasmid
- Did trasncription of crRNAs and purification of Cas12a protein
- CADS method included PCR, Sanger sequencing analysis etc.
