Title: A unified multitask architecture for predicting local protein properties

Abstract:
- Create a neural network to figure out protein properties based on amino acid sequence
- State of the art and novel
- What are the intricacies of this model? And what is the task presented?

Introduction:
- Using natural language processing to understand what proteins do
- Multitask learning: train on many, related tasks
- The tasks people have already worked on are actually interrelated
- Train the deep neural network in a multitask fashion
- State of the art performance on almost all tasks

Methods:
-
