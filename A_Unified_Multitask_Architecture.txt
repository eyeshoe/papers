Title: A unified multitask architecture for predicting local protein properties

Abstract:
- Create a neural network to figure out protein properties based on amino acid sequence
- State of the art and novel
- What are the intricacies of this model? And what is the task presented?

Introduction:
- Using natural language processing to understand what proteins do
- Multitask learning: train on many, related tasks
- The tasks people have already worked on are actually interrelated
- Train the deep neural network in a multitask fashion
- State of the art performance on almost all tasks

Methods:
- Prediction tasks (10 labeling that are similar)
- Describe the series of prediction tasks and then understand how deep learning is useful
- Secondary Structure: 
  - general 3-d form of the protein
  - 3 secondary structure tasks in data set
- Topology and signal peptide prediction
  - transmembrane topology: geometric properties of transmembrane proteins
  - figure of merit is protein level accuracy
- Solvent accessibility
  - which amino acids are exposed to water and which are not
  - metric of accuracy is labellings
- Coiled coil regions
  - protein structural motifs, predict where these are
  - Paircoil algorithm dataset
  - percent correct metric
- DNA binding:
  - which amino acids interact with DNA
  - clustering then cross validation
- Protein binding residues:
  - binding sites for protein-protein interactions
- Deep Neural network for each task:
  - architecture summarized in a figure
  - amino acid feature extraction
  - sequential feature extraction layer
  - classical neural network layers
  - weight sharing strategy used
  - pre-training strategy
 - unlabeled sequences:
  - useful nlp tools here

Results:
- Torch5 ML library used
- Hypothesis: three fold
  - learning amino acid embedding
  - using multitask learning
  - include natural protein task
- Focus on accuracy evaluated at amino acid level
- multitask architecture only improves in 7/10 times for amino acid embedding
- 9/10 in other tasks though
- multitask learning improves all the cases, better than state of the art
