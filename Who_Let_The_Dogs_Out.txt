Title: Who let the dogs out? Modeling Dog Behavior from Visual Data

Abstract:
- Task: directly modeling a visually intelligent agent
- DECADE: a dataset of ego-centric videos from a dog's perspective
- Representation can generalize to other domains

Introduction:
- Visual intelligence: understanding visual data to the extent that an agent can take actions and perform tasks in the visual world
- Goal is to learn to act like the visually intelligent agent
- Using a dog, have a specific dataset
- Three main problems: learn to act like a dog, learn to plan like a dog, do representation learning

Related Work:
- There's no work in this exact area, lots of similar work in other areas
- These pieces range around the idea of motivation prediction and appearance prediction
- Includes topics like supervised learning, inverse reinforcement learning etc.

Dataset:
