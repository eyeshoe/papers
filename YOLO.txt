Title: You Only Look Once- Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

Abstract:
- New approach to object detection
- Using bounding boxes to detect objects rather than classification
- Outperforms DPM and R-CNN when generalizing on testing images

Introduction:
- Sliding window and R-CNN are slow and not optimized enough
- YOLO means you only look at an image once
- A single conv net predicts multiple bounding boxes and associated probabilities
- Can process streaming video in real time, more than twice mean avg precision
- Less background errors b/c it sees the entire image
- Sometimes it doesn't precisely localize objects that well

Unified Detection:
- Single network, predicts all bounding boxes for an image
- Each grid cell predicts confidence, x, y, w, h and eventually class
- Divide the image into S*S grid
- Implement model as a CNN, evaluate on PASCAL VOC dataset
- Fast YOLO vs YOLO: mostly the same, fewer conv layers in fast version
- Multiple bounding boxes based on anchors, max prob suppression too
- Yolo has spatial constraints on bounding box predictions
- Doesn't generalize well to objects in new aspect ratios
