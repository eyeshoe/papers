Title: DeepSimulator: a deep simulator for Nanopore Sequencing

Abstract:
- Currently available simulators for Oxford Nanopore Sequencing are simple
- DeepSimulator mimics the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing
- Useful for developing tools in de novo assembly and in low coverage SNP detection

Introduction:
- NGS techniques include Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio
- Data analysis tools are also emerging and better
- Not a good enough simulator yet, needs to be natural for Nanopore sequencing
- DeepSimulator mimics the entire process pipeline and is context dependent

Materials and methods:
-
