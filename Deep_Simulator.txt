Title: DeepSimulator: a deep simulator for Nanopore Sequencing

Abstract:
- Currently available simulators for Oxford Nanopore Sequencing are simple
- DeepSimulator mimics the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing
- Useful for developing tools in de novo assembly and in low coverage SNP detection

Introduction:
- NGS techniques include Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio
- Data analysis tools are also emerging and better
- Not a good enough simulator yet, needs to be natural for Nanopore sequencing
- DeepSimulator mimics the entire process pipeline and is context dependent

Materials and methods:
- Three stages of nanopore sequencing, need to go through all 3
- Need to account for a lot of error when determining the length of a read
- Built a pore model in consideration of context
- Used a Bi-LSTM Neural Network Architecture --> this becomes the pore model
- Used 4 nanopore sequencing datasets

Results:
- DeepSimulator satisfies all criteria for success --> length distribution, similar signals, and same profile reads
- Used Dynamic Time Warping to confirm a lot of these results
- This is going to be useful in de novo assembly

Conclusion:
- There are advantages to using DeepSimulator to simulate Nanopore Sequencing
